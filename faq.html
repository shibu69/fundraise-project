    <h3>What is crowdfunding?</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
            Crowdfunding is a quick and easy way to raise money using the internet and social media. Using an online fundraising platform, you can raise the required amounts through donations from across India to help with any social, medical, personal, or creative need.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            One can also start a fundraiser to receive help for medical emergencies, disaster relief work, support a non-profit or a social cause, and even raise funds for personal needs such as medical treatment, education, or businesses. So, when you are worried and need help paying for medicine? You need to start a fundraiser, and through your fundraising campaign, you can appeal for financial help to cover medical treatment.
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Is crowdfunding legal in India?</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
            Yes, online donation-based crowdfunding for social, medical, and personal causes is legal in India. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) considers all forms of crowdfunding legal in India except for equity crowdfunding. Specific crowdfunding organisations are registered under the Income Tax Act as charitable trusts. Contributions made to such donation platforms are eligible for income tax deductions under section 80G.
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>Do we need to return the funds raised on donation-based crowdfunding platforms?</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
            Money contributed towards your fundraiser is considered a donation or a gift, and you are not liable to return the money at any point. This no-payback liability ensures you can pay for a medical or personal need without worrying about debt.
            <br><br>
            In online crowdfunding, you don’t have to pay back the goal amount you raised, which is impossible when taking a personal loan for a medical emergency. Also, an individual doesn’t have to pay high interest to raise funds for treatment compared to bank loans that include a high-interest rate for medical bills. You don’t have to pay back anything to a crowdfunding platform when raising money to get help pay for your medical treatment. All you need to do is to create a fundraiser first.
        </ul>

    <h3>What is the difference between medical crowdfunding and medical loans?</h3>
    <div>
    <ul>
        Medical crowdfunding and medical loans are two distinct methods of financing healthcare expenses. Here are the key differences between taking a medical loan, and raising money online through medical fundraising:<br>
        <b>a) Source of funds:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Medical crowdfunding:</b> Funds are raised by many people, typically through an online crowdfunding platform. These contributors can include friends, family, acquaintances, and even strangers who support the cause.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Medical loans:</b> Funds are borrowed from a financial institution, such as a bank or a specialized medical loan provider, which must be paid back over time with interest.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>b) Repayment:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Medical crowdfunding:</b>Generally, there is no requirement to repay the funds received through crowdfunding, as the money is raised through donations.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Medical loans:</b> Generally, there is no requirement to repay the funds received through crowdfunding, as the money is raised through donations.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>c) Interest and fees:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Medical crowdfunding:</b>While most crowdfunding platforms charge a small percentage of the funds raised as a fee, there is usually no interest charged on the funds received.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Medical loans:</b>Interest rates and fees are applied to medical loans, increasing the overall cost of the loan over time.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>d) Impact on credit score:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Medical crowdfunding:</b> Raising funds through crowdfunding typically does not impact the borrower's credit score.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Medical loans:</b> Borrowing a medical loan can affect the borrower's credit score. Timely repayment of the loan can improve the credit score, while late or missed payments can negatively impact it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b>e) Eligibility and approval:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Medical Crowdfunding:</b> There is usually no stringent eligibility criteria to start a medical crowdfunding campaign. However, the success of the campaign depends on the ability to attract donors and effectively communicate the need for funds.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Medical loans:</b> Eligibility for medical loans depends on factors such as credit score, income, employment history, and existing debts. Approval can take time and may not be guaranteed.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        Both medical crowdfunding and medical loans have their advantages and disadvantages. The right choice depends on individual circumstances, financial needs, and the urgency of the situation. It's essential to carefully consider your options and evaluate the potential benefits and drawbacks of each method before deciding on how you’d want to finance your treatment. If you do plan on raising money online for emergency medical funds, without taking a medical loan, ensure you use top rated fundraising platform or website such as Impact Guru. You can fundraise for your medical causes from a network of 30 lakh donors on Impact Guru, which has been consistently rated as one of the best online fundraising platforms for nonprofits and financing medical expenses.
